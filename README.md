## I2C Isolator with Power 
This is likely the smallest PCB that combines I2C and power isolation in a compact design. 
It delivers 1W of isolated output power, all within an extremely small form factor. 
It connects seamlessly to your microcontroller project using a STEMMA QT (JST SH 4-Pin) cable, ideal for isolating your sensor board.

## Use cases:
- Applications requiring electrical isolation
- Long wiring runs where signal integrity suffers
- Prevention of ground loops and noise
